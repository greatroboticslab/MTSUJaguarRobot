## 🎯 How to Use

### For Development/Testing (No Robot Hardware)
```bash
cd /Users/danielpowers/Desktop/MTSUJaguarRobot
./setup.sh start
# Opens at: http://127.0.0.1:5014
```

### For Robot Control (With Hardware)
```bash
cd /Users/danielpowers/Desktop/MTSUJaguarRobot
python3 network_config.py robot    # Configure network
./setup.sh start                   # Start application
```
